      <h1>About Ezekiel</h1>
      <p>
        I&apos;m Ezekiel, the mind behind this webapp dedicated to all things web development and data analysis. With a passion for technology that burns brighter than the Lagos sun, I&apos;ve spent years honing my skills as a software engineer and data analyst.</p>

        <p><b>Tech Enthusiast:</b> I breathe JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js. From crafting seamless user interfaces with React to diving into the data world with SQL and MongoDB, I&apos;ve done it all. My toolkit includes everything from Express.js for robust backends to Next.js for server-side rendering.</p>

        <p><b>Full Stack Dev & More:</b> I&apos;m not just about coding; I&apos;m about creating. As a full stack developer, I believe in building end-to-end solutions. But that&apos;s not all. I&apos;m a PHP enthusiast, a CSS magician, and a fan of Tailwind CSS for crafting sleek and responsive designs.</p>

        <p><b>Data Whisperer:</b> Data analysis is my secret superpower. I thrive on deciphering data, uncovering insights, and turning numbers into stories. SQL is my trusted companion for database wizardry, and I dance with data using tools like Microsoft Excel and Python.</p>

        <p><b>Education & Sharing:</b> Knowledge is power, and I&apos;m a firm believer in sharing it. I&apos;ve been known to dive deep into tech books and admire the wonders of space engineering. My ultimate goal? To help you become a tech wizard, whether you&apos;re just starting out or on a quest for expertise.</p>

        <p>Join me on this journey of learning, problem-solving, and innovation. Together, we&apos;ll master the ever-evolving world of web development and data analysis. Let&apos;s build a brighter, tech-savvier future, one code at a time.</p>
